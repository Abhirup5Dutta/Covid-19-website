                Government of India is taking all necessary steps to ensure that we are prepared well to face the
                challenge and threat posed by the growing pandemic of COVID-19 the Corona Virus. With active support of
                the people of India, we have been able to contain the spread of the Virus in our country. The most
                important factor in preventing the spread of the Virus locally is to empower the citizens with the right
                information and taking precautions as per the advisories being issued by Ministry of Health & Family
                Welfare.

                    A: The second phase of the vaccination drive in which everyone above 60 years of age and those over
                    45 years with comorbidities will be able to get the COVID-19 vaccine. he vaccine will be

                </p>
                <p>
                    A: Some early studies suggest between 1 in 5 and 1 in 10 people with COVID-19 will experience
                    symptoms lasting longer than a month. A majority of those who were admitted to hospital with severe
                    disease report long-term problems including fatigue and shortness of breath.

                <p>
                    A: Although for most people COVID-19 causes only mild illness, it can make some people very ill.
                    More rarely, the disease can be fatal. Older people, and those with pre- existing medical conditions
                    (such as high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes) appear to be more vulnerable.

                <p>
                    A: The next phase of the world's largest coronavirus vaccination drive for the age-appropriate
                    population groups started from 1 March, 2021. All vaccines provided to beneficiaries at the
                    government health facilities will be entirely free of cost, while private facilities will charge a
                    sum of ₹250 per person per dose.

                <p>
                    A: The virus that causes COVID-19 infects people of all ages. However, evidence to date suggests
                    that two groups of people are at a higher risk of getting severe COVID-19 disease. These are older
                    people (that is people over 60 years old); and those with underlying medical conditions (such as
                    cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer).

                <p>
                    A: SARS-CoV-2 RNA has also been detected in other biological samples, including the urine and feces
                    of some patients. One study found viable SARS-CoV-2 in the urine of one patient. Three studies have
                    cultured SARS-CoV-2 from stool specimens. To date, however, there have been no published reports of
                    transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through feces or urine.

                    Q: Can the coronavirus disease spread through feces?
                </p>
                <p>
                    A: The risk of catching the COVID-19 virus from the faeces of an infected person appears to be low.

                    There is some evidence that the COVID-19 virus may lead to intestinal infection and be present in
                    faeces. Approximately 2−10% of cases of confirmed COVID-19 disease presented with diarrhoea (2−4),
                    and two studies detected COVID-19 viral RNA fragments in the faecal matter of COVID-19 patients
                    (5,6).

                    However, to date only one study has cultured the COVID-19 virus from a single stool specimen (7).
                    There have been no reports of faecal−oral transmission of the COVID-19 virus.

                </p>
                <p>
                    A: While there is no evidence to date about survival of the COVID-19 virus in water or sewage, the
                    virus is likely to become inactivated significantly faster than non-enveloped human enteric viruses
                    with known waterborne transmission (such as adenoviruses, norovirus, rotavirus and hepatitis A).

                <p>
                    A: Cold weather and snow CANNOT kill the new coronavirus.
                    There is no reason to believe that cold weather can kill the new coronavirus or other diseases.
